# M4R Modelling Spatio-Temporal Data
 My R code that I have used to generate key results and graphs throughout my MSci Mathematics project. 

 The code aims to investigate spatio-temporal climate data in the contiguous United States. 

 The R files relate to initial startup steps and key introductory functions that are commonly used, and then a more focused temporal and spatial analysis of the data.
