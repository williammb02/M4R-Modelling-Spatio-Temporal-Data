# M4R Modelling Spatio-Temporal Data
 My R code that I have used to generate key results and graphs throughout my MSci Mathematics project. 

 The code aims to investigate spatio-temporal climate data in the contiguous United States. 

 The files included correspond to specific areas of statistical analysis undertaken throughout the project.
 - initial.R: code containing all libraries and key functions needed to analyse the data
 - spatial.R: code containing all spatial statistical analysis
 - temporal.R: code containing all temporal statistical analysis - specifically time series and correlations of variables varying over time
 - distributions.R: code fitting distributions to specific climate variables
 - distributions_hourly.R: as above but using hourly data rather than monthly
 - extremes.R: code looking at extremal dependence among climate variables
 - extremes_hourly.R: as above but using hourly data rather than monthly
 - time_series_models.R: code fitting various decompositions and time series models to the data
 - time_series_extremes.R: code applying extreme value theory to our time series and residuals
